# 🏀Basketball Scoreboard
This is a simple digital scoreboard for a basketball game, built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. It allows users to simulate a game by updating the scores for two teams—Home and Guest—with just a click. The app provides buttons for incrementing the score by 1, 2, or 3 points for each team. The only interactivity in the project is click-based score updates, handled entirely through DOM manipulation with JavaScript.
